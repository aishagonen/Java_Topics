A.java:
public class A {
	
	public void a(){} 					==> method ve variable ayni isim olabilir. 
	int a;
	
}

B.java:
public class B {
	
	private int doStuff() {				==> local variable private olur mu? 
		private int x = 100;				El-cevab:No, it is a syntax error, you can not use access modifiers within a method.
		return x++;									You can have private fields in a class, but this is different. 
	}												You can not declare any variable with access specifier within a method.
}													You can do it by defining inner class and declaring private variables inside that.
													Variables inside method are considered local and can't have modifiers. 
C.java: 
import java.io.*;
package p1;
class A {

	public void main(String fileName) throws IOException{ }
